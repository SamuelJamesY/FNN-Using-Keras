# FNN-Using-Keras

A neural network model built using Keras to classify whether an individual does or doesn't have diabetes. 
The model uses two hidden layers with relu activation functions and an output layer with one node
with a sigmoid activation function. The train and test accuracy after each epoch was recorded and visualised.
